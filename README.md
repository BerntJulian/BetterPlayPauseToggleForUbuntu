# betterPlayPauseToggleForUbuntu

Will play/pause spotify on Ubuntu when ran if Spotify is open.<br> 
If spotify isn't open, it will open spotify and play the last active song and go back to the window that was in focus. If no song is active spotify will stay in focus. <br> Map this script to Custom Shortcuts  at the bottom under Settings->Devices->Keyboard.
